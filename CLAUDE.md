# CLAUDE.md, the H.C. Andersen house

This is the H.C. Andersen production house (`khai-plays-hcandersen`), raised by
khai-stage. The plays are written separately, in khai-playwright mode.

**Voice first.** Operate under the
[management instructions](management/management_instructions.md): the khai
**voice and mechanics** (who speaks, the company, management orders). _Then_ this
file is the **coding contract** for the house. Voice and mechanics there; coding
rules here. The order matters: management voice first, coding second.

## Branching

Computed, not chosen. Let the guard pick the lane:

```
npx khai-guard branch <topic>
```

- `play/<topic>` owns `plays/**` (the productions).
- `governance/<topic>` owns the gates and config (`.github/**`, `.husky/**`,
  `khai-guard.config.json`, `tests/**`, `audit/**`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `README.md`, `REFERENCE.md`, `REFERENCES.md`, `management/**`).
- `changeset-release/*` is a bot-controlled general lane for version releases.

A **management order** (`management/orders/**`) is a **rider**: an order directs
work in any lane, so it rides the lane of the change it drives. Write the order
beside that change and the guard folds both onto one branch (an order that
restages a play lands as one `play/` PR); committed alone, an order homes to
`governance/`. So an order and the change it commands are one PR, never two.

Never `--no-verify`. Never merge; open the PR and stop.

## Versioning

The minor version IS the play count, computed not chosen. `khai-tests registry
build` (run by the `version` script) sets the version from the play count:
`0.<count>.0` (the minor is the count, the patch resets to 0), reconciling both
`package.json` and `registry.json`. The build is the single writer of the
version; never hand-edit it.

- **Adding a play** -> no changeset. The play PR runs `khai-tests registry build`,
  which moves the minor to the new play count and resets the patch to 0
  (`0.<count>.0`); `changeset publish` ships it. A per-play changeset would
  re-bump the patch on top of the minor the build already moved, the
  `0.<count>.1` drift to avoid.
- **A non-play change that ships package content** (a fix to an existing play,
  the registry, the README) -> a `patch` changeset; it ships at the same play
  count.
- **A change that ships no package content** -> an **empty** changeset
  (`npx changeset add --empty`). Anything outside the package `files`
  (`REFERENCES.md`, docs, tooling, the gates, this file) ships nothing, so a
  `patch` changeset there republishes identical content and drifts the version
  (the `0.<count>.1` patch). An empty changeset records the PR and merges green
  without cutting a release. Staging a coming play in `REFERENCES.md` is the
  common case: empty, not patch. `changeset-check` flags a releasing changeset
  that ships nothing.

A non-zero major resets the minor while the count keeps climbing, so a house
stays `0.x`; the numbering guard rejects a major bump.

## Protection
